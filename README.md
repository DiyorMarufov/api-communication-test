API Communication Test
Overview

This project demonstrates how to communicate with a test API to receive two-part codes and combine them into a final message using Node.js and Express.

How it works:

Send a POST request to the test API with msg and url (your webhook).

Receive the first part of the code in the API response.

The second part of the code is sent to your webhook URL.

Concatenate both parts and send a GET request with the combined code to get the final message.

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/DiyorMarufov/api-communication-test.git
cd api-communication-test


Install dependencies:

npm install


Add "type": "module" in package.json if you are using ES Module syntax:

{
  "type": "module"
}


Start the server on port 4000:

npm run dev

Using Localtunnel (Webhook)

Expose your local server to the internet:

npx localtunnel --port 4000


Copy the URL generated by localtunnel (e.g., https://abcd1234.loca.lt) and use it as your webhook URL in the script:

const webhook_url = "https://abcd1234.loca.lt";


Run your Node.js script. The script will automatically:

POST to the test API

Receive part2 on your webhook

Combine both parts and GET the final message

Output

The final message and combined key will be shown in the console.
