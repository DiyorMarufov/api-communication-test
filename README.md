# API Communication Test

A Node.js project demonstrating HTTP communication with a test API, receiving a two-part code, and combining it to retrieve a final message.  

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project shows how to:

1. Send a `POST` request to the test API with your message and webhook URL.  
2. Receive the **first part** of the code from the API response.  
3. Receive the **second part** of the code at your webhook URL.  
4. Concatenate both parts and send a `GET` request to retrieve the final message.  

**Tech used:**  
- Node.js  
- Express  
- Axios  
- Localtunnel (for exposing your local webhook to the internet)

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DiyorMarufov/api-communication-test.git
cd api-communication-test
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Enable ES Modules (if using import syntax):
Add "type": "module" in package.json:

json
Copy code
{
  "type": "module"
}
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Server runs on port 4000.

🌐 Using Localtunnel (Webhook)
Expose your local server to the internet using Localtunnel:

bash
Copy code
npx localtunnel --port 4000
Copy the URL generated by Localtunnel, e.g.:

arduino
Copy code
https://abcd1234.loca.lt
Set it as your webhook URL in app.js (or your script):

js
Copy code
const webhook_url = "https://abcd1234.loca.lt";
Run your Node.js script. The script will automatically:

Send a POST request to the test API

Receive the second part of the code via your webhook

Combine both parts

GET the final message

📌 Output
The final message and combined key will be displayed in the console.

💡 Notes
Make sure your local server is running before sending the POST request.

Localtunnel URL will change each time you run it unless you use a paid account.

If you face connection issues, check your internet or firewall settings
