# API Communication Test

A Node.js project demonstrating HTTP communication with a test API, receiving a two-part code, and combining it to retrieve a final message.  

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project shows how to:

1. Send a `POST` request to the test API with your message and webhook URL.  
2. Receive the **first part** of the code from the API response.  
3. Receive the **second part** of the code at your webhook URL.  
4. Concatenate both parts and send a `GET` request to retrieve the final message.  

**Tech used:**  
- Node.js  
- Express  
- Axios  
- Localtunnel (for exposing your local webhook to the internet)  

---


How it works:
## 🛠 Installation
1.Install dependencies:

npm install

Localtunnel URL will change each time you run it unless you use a paid account.

2.Using Localtunnel (Webhook)

Expose your local server to the internet using Localtunnel:

npx localtunnel --port 4000

Copy the URL generated by Localtunnel, e.g.:

https://abcd1234.loca.lt

Set it as your webhook URL in app.js (or your script):

const webhook_url = "https://abcd1234.loca.lt";

3.Start the server:

npm run dev

Server runs on port 4000.
